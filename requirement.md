To create a "To-Do List Manager" using Python and object-oriented programming (OOP), you can follow these hints:

Define a Task class:

The Task class represents an individual task with attributes such as a description and completion status.
It should have methods to set and retrieve the task description and completion status.
Define a ToDoList class:

The ToDoList class represents the collection of tasks.
It should have a list or other suitable data structure to store the tasks.
Implement methods to add a new task, mark a task as completed, remove a task, and retrieve the list of tasks.
Implement the Task class:

Define the Task class with appropriate attributes and methods.
For example, the Task class might have attributes like description and completed, along with methods like get_description(), set_description(), is_completed(), and set_completed().
Implement the ToDoList class:

Define the ToDoList class with appropriate attributes and methods.
For example, the ToDoList class might have an attribute like tasks (a list) and methods like add_task(), mark_task_as_completed(), remove_task(), and get_task_list().
Create an instance of the ToDoList class:

In your main program, create an instance of the ToDoList class to work with.
Use this instance to interact with the tasks, add new tasks, mark tasks as completed, remove tasks, and retrieve the task list.
By implementing this structure, you can achieve a modular and OOP-based design for your "To-Do List Manager." It allows you to encapsulate task-related functionality within the Task class and manage the collection of tasks using the ToDoList class.

Remember to consider error handling, input validation, and persistence (saving the task list to a file) as you continue to enhance your program.
